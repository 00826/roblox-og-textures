## About DDS files:

https://fileinfo.com/extension/dds

"A DDS file is a raster image saved in the DirectDraw Surface (DDS) container format. It can store compressed and uncompressed pixel formats DDS files are often used for texturing video game unit models, but may also be used to store digital photos and Windows desktop backgrounds."

## Converting DDS files to .png:

Just google it, I plan on updating the repository with converted .png images; I just wanted to make the initial commit out of spite of this post: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/new-terrain-and-parts-built-in-materials-release-build/1269335

## Recommended software to edit/manipulate DDS files:

"DDS Utilities"
