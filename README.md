# roblox-og-textures
Roblox doesn't play Roblox.

Textures originally forked from build: ***version-b84e47443964487e***

Obtainable by digging into %appdata% until I found the texture file

C:\Users\ovarflode\AppData\Local\Roblox\Versions\[version-id]

## Overwriting local files to show the og-textures:

1. Go to %appdata%
2. Go 1 folder above (Local)
3. Open `Roblox`
4. Open `Versions`
5. Find the folder that has a `PlatformContent` folder
6. Go into the folder and look for a `textures` folder (for me it was \[version-id]\PlatformContent\pc\textures)
7. Paste the contents of the raw-textures folder inside

## About DDS files:

https://fileinfo.com/extension/dds

"A DDS file is a raster image saved in the DirectDraw Surface (DDS) container format. It can store compressed and uncompressed pixel formats DDS files are often used for texturing video game unit models, but may also be used to store digital photos and Windows desktop backgrounds."

## Converting DDS files to .png:

Just google it, I plan on updating the repository with converted .png images; I just wanted to make the initial commit out of spite of this post: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/new-terrain-and-parts-built-in-materials-release-build/1269335

## Recommended software to edit/manipulate DDS files:

"DDS Utilities"
